  It's still early days for this package. It's entirely
  likely that whatever you're trying to do is meant to be
  supported, it's just that we haven't encountered your
  type of environment before.

  As such, please provide as much detail about your project
  setup, folder structure, version of Node, etc as you can
  to help get to the bottom of things as quickly as possible.
